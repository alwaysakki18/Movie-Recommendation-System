# Movie-Recommendation-System
A Machine Learning content-based Movie Recommendation System project using Python.
This content-based filtering model works based on Cosine similarity, Feature Extraction and Vectorization.
It involves Python standard libraries such as Numpy, Pandas, Scikit Learn and Difflib.
I developed this project during my internship at G-Tech Solutions from December 2023 to January 2024. It is a small-scale project for Learning purposes that covers all the basics of Python, Python for Data Science, and Machine Learning.
